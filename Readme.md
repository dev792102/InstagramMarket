# InstaMarket

InstaMarket is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to revolutionize the way users buy and sell Instagram pages. Deployed on the EduChain blockchain, this platform offers a secure, transparent, and efficient way for individuals to trade Instagram pages. The application allows users to list their Instagram pages for sale, view available pages, and purchase them using EDU tokens. By utilizing blockchain technology, InstaMarket ensures trust and safety for both sellers and buyers.

## Features

- **List Instagram Pages for Sale**: Users can list their Instagram pages for sale by providing essential details such as page name, followers count, username (hidden for privacy), password (hidden for security), and price (denominated in EDU).
- **View Available Pages**: Users can browse through a list of Instagram pages available for purchase. Each page includes details like name, followers count, price in EDU, and whether the page has already been sold or not.
- **Buy Instagram Pages**: Potential buyers can purchase Instagram pages using EDU tokens. If the page is available for sale, buyers can easily complete the transaction via the DApp interface.
- **Secure Transactions**: By utilizing blockchain technology, InstaMarket ensures that all transactions are immutable and transparent. The buying process is conducted using EDU tokens on the EduChain blockchain, ensuring smooth and secure operations.

## How It Works

InstaMarket connects sellers and buyers through smart contracts deployed on the EduChain blockchain. Sellers can create a listing for their Instagram page, including the page's name, follower count, price, and whether the page is already sold. Buyers can then view the available pages, and if interested, purchase them using EDU tokens. Once a transaction is completed, the page details are transferred to the buyer, and the seller receives the payment.

### User Flow:
1. **Listing a Page**: 
    - Sellers provide the page name, followers, username, password (hidden), price in EDU, and select whether the page is available for sale.
    - The listing is stored securely on the blockchain, making it transparent and accessible for buyers to view.
  
2. **Buying a Page**:
    - Buyers can browse through available pages and view details such as name, followers, and price.
    - If the page is not marked as "sold," buyers can proceed with the purchase.
    - Once a page is bought, the sale is recorded on the blockchain, and the page is marked as "sold."

3. **View Available Pages**:
    - Users can view a list of all available Instagram pages for sale.
    - The list includes essential details like page name, followers, price in EDU, and whether the page is sold.
  
## Contract Details

By using EDU tokens, InstaMarket ensures that transactions are cost-effective and easy for users to engage with, whether they are listing a page for sale or purchasing one.

## Security Considerations

InstaMarket takes security seriously by leveraging the power of the blockchain to ensure the integrity of all transactions. Sensitive data such as usernames and passwords of Instagram pages are never stored on the blockchain, making the platform safer for both buyers and sellers. All interactions on the DApp, including page listings and purchases, are secured through blockchain-based smart contracts, which guarantee transparency and immutability.

## Benefits of Using InstaMarket

- **Decentralization**: InstaMarket operates on the EduChain blockchain, which means that it is not controlled by a single entity. This ensures that all transactions are transparent, verifiable, and secure.
- **Ownership and Privacy**: Buyers and sellers retain full control over their Instagram pages and personal data, with private details like usernames and passwords hidden during the transaction process.
- **Low Fees**: By using EDU tokens on the EduChain blockchain, users can enjoy low transaction fees compared to traditional platforms.
- **Security and Transparency**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. Once a page is listed for sale or purchased, the transaction is immutable and visible to all participants.
